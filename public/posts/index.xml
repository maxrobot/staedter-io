      <description>In 2009 at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh the largest global economies took a long hard look at themselves and asked the question, ‘how do we stop that happening again?’.
Of course, they were talking about the global financial crash and the failure of Lehman brothers.

      <description>In this short post we explain how blockchain technology can be used for more than simple value transfer between two counterparties. Indeed, we discuss how blockchain, and DLT, enables not just removal of the intermediaries in payments but also the third-parties responsible for calculations throughout the entire trade life-cycle.
Where are we? The introduction of intermediaries to maintain ledgers of deposits was a key development in the history of money. The ability for merchants to deposit in one city and withdraw in another enabled movement of capital on a larger scale than before and was responsible for a significant rise in global economic development.</description>
