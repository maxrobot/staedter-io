In this short post we explain how blockchain technology can be used for more than simple value transfer between two counterparties. Indeed, we discuss how blockchain, and DLT, enables not just removal of the intermediaries in payments but also the third-parties responsible for calculations throughout the entire trade life-cycle.

## Where are we?

The introduction of intermediaries to maintain ledgers of deposits was a key development in the history of money. The ability for merchants to deposit in one city and withdraw in another enabled movement of capital on a larger scale than before and was responsible for a significant rise in global economic development. These intermediaries had to be trusted by depositors not to spend or lose their deposits.

This simple story is in large the motivation of Bitcoin and is the typical lens through which blockchain technology is viewed - i.e., solving the double-spend problem. Of course, this is a key use-case, blockchain can provide a shared ledger enabling two counterparties to transfer  value between one another without needing a third party to oversee.

However, it is so much more.

## Valuation and Trustless Computation

In addition to maintaining a ledger of balances, another role given to third parties in financial transactions is to perform pricing and valuation. This ranges from determining the price of a complex derivative product to simply the summation of the net position of a portfolio. The point being that this intermediary has a discretionary responsibility.

For example, in the ISDA framework the counterparties designate a valuation agent as part of their master agreement. The valuation agent is given the task of calculating the mark-to-market of the counterparties portfolio. Additionally, the may use a calculation agent, again a third party, who has the final say on the pricing of the counterparties trades.

These valuation and calculation agents have a high degree of discretion over how they arrive at a valuation. Unsurprisingly this arrangement usually ends up favouring one of the two parties in the agreement.

So, what can we do if we don't agree with the value?

One solution is to assign a co-calculation agent or pursue a legal dispute. In either case it is a slow and expensive way of arriving at an answer - and you still might not like that answer.

## How can blockchain help?

In addition to the ability to transfer value between users some blockchains have the ability to run computer programs. Typically known as smart contracts these programs can be run without the need for a third party to provide the computational resources to do so. Meaning that instead of a relying on the third party to perform our calculation we are able to execute them using the blockchain network.

How does this help financial transactions?

Being able to run calculations without a third party can help to remove the disputes and asymmetries that arise as part of the pricing and valuation of counterparties trades.

Using a blockchain to run smart contracts counterparties will be able to agree a priori the valuation method for their portfolio and individual trades. Not only does this remove the ambiguity of the valuations, but it enables users to use identical pricing methodologies.

Disputes due to valuation disagreements and other operational errors add in excess of $3+ billion to the cost of trading [1]. Therefore the elimination of disputes has the potential to create significant savings for market participants. 

Additionally, the creation of shared and transparent pricing methodologies is one step towards the creation of new financial products such as smart contract derivatives. Already a great deal of work in this area in the DeFi space but the real prize is adoption by traditional financial market participants.

## Conclusion

Blockchain and smart contract can provide market participants with the tools and infrastructure to use trustless execution in the pricing and valuation of their trade obligations. This is just a small part of our platform that enables automated prime brokerage for market participants. Reducing, if not eliminating, valuation disputes is a key way of reducing the cost and failure rates in post-trade operations.
